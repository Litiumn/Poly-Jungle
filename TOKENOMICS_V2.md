## 📈 Staking System

### Lock Periods & APY

| Period | Lock Days | Base APY | Early Unstake Penalty | Emoji |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Flexible | 0 | 3% | 0% | 🔓 |
| 7 Days | 7 | 8% | 5% | 🔒 |
| 30 Days | 30 | 18% | 10% | 🔐 |
| 90 Days | 90 | 35% | 20% | 🏆 |

### Rarity Multipliers

| Rarity | Multiplier |
|--------|-----------|
| Common Grove | 1.0x |
| Wildwood | 1.3x |
| Sacred Canopy | 1.6x |
| Elderbark | 2.0x |
| Mythroot | 3.0x |
| Celestial Bough | 4.5x |
| Origin Tree | 8.0x |

### Dynamic APY Adjustment

The effective APY automatically adjusts based on global token supply:

```
effectiveAPY = baseAPY × (1 - (circulatingSupply / maxSupply) × 0.5)
```

This prevents runaway inflation as more tokens are staked.
