## 🎮 How to Play

### Planting (2 Methods)

**Method A: Plant Button**
1. Click big green "PLANT" button (bottom-center)
2. Select a seed from menu
3. Tree plants automatically

**Method B: Click Terrain**
1. Click anywhere on green ground
2. Select a seed from menu
3. Tree plants at that spot

### Earning Eco-Points

- 🗑️ **Clean Trash**: Click red cubes → +5 points
- 💧 **Water Trees**: Click trees → +2 points (once per day)
- 🌱 **Initial**: Start with 500 points

### Growing Trees

- **Automatic**: Trees grow in real-time
- **Stages**: seed (30m) → sprout (1h) → young (2h) → mature
- **Bonus**: Water daily for +10% growth speed
- **Persistent**: Growth continues even when closed

### Other Actions

- 🌦️ **Weather**: Click weather icon (top-right)
- 🔧 **Debug**: Click "Debug" button (bottom-left)
- 📊 **Stats**: View eco-points, trees, score (top bar)

## 💡 Common Tasks

### Task: Test Planting

```bash
# 1. Run game
pnpm dev

# 2. Enter forest
# 3. Click "PLANT" button
# 4. Select Oak (cost: 50)
# 5. See tree appear at center
```

### Task: Test Growth

```bash
# Method 1: Wait 30 minutes
# Trees will progress naturally

# Method 2: Modify timestamps (advanced)
# 1. Open DevTools → Application → localStorage
# 2. Find "ecoforest_self_contained"
# 3. Edit "plantedAt" to 2 hours ago
# 4. Refresh page
# 5. Tree should be mature stage
```

### Task: Test Persistence

```bash
# 1. Plant 3 trees
# 2. Clean 2 trash items
# 3. Note eco-points balance
# 4. Refresh page (F5)
# 5. Verify all data still there
```

### Task: Add Eco-Points

```bash
# 1. Click "Debug" button (bottom-left)
# 2. Click "+Add 500 Eco-Points"
# 3. Balance increases immediately
```

### Task: Reset Everything

```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
// Creates fresh game with starting resources
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Three.js Primitives (No External Models)

- **Trees**: Cylinder trunk + sphere/cone foliage
- **Terrain**: 20×20 plane with sine wave hills
- **Lake**: Circle geometry (blue, transparent)
- **Rocks**: Dodecahedrons (grey)
- **Trash**: Small cubes (red)
- **Rain**: Point particles (animated)

### UI Style

- **Organic**: Embedded in forest, not dashboard
- **Nature-themed**: Leaf icons, wooden frames
- **Color-coded**: Green (eco-points), Amber (trees), Blue (score)
- **Prominent**: Large pulsing plant button

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Growth Speed

Edit `src/lib/self-contained-storage.ts`:

```typescript
const GROWTH_DURATIONS_HOURS = {
  Oak: { sprout: 0.5, young: 1, mature: 2 },
  // Change to: { sprout: 6, young: 24, mature: 72 }
  // for realistic production timing
};
```

### Change Starting Resources

Edit `src/lib/self-contained-storage.ts`:

```typescript
ecoPoints: 500,  // Change to 1000 for easier start
inventory: {
  Oak: 2,        // Change to 5 for more seeds
  // ...
},
```

### Change Seed Costs

Edit `src/lib/self-contained-storage.ts`:

```typescript
const SEED_COSTS = {
  Oak: 50,     // Change to 25 for cheaper
  Pine: 60,    // Change to 30 for cheaper
  // ...
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Trees Not Appearing

**Solution 1**: Check eco-points (need ≥50 for Oak)  
**Solution 2**: Check location (not in lake, not too close to others)  
**Solution 3**: Use debug panel to add eco-points  

### Problem: Trees Not Growing

**Solution 1**: Wait at least 30 minutes  
**Solution 2**: Check localStorage for valid timestamps  
**Solution 3**: Modify growth durations for testing  

### Problem: Can't Plant Anywhere

**Solution 1**: Lake is at (6, 6) — avoid that area  
**Solution 2**: Must be 2+ units from existing trees  
**Solution 3**: Try clicking different terrain spots  

### Problem: Page Won't Load

**Solution 1**: Check browser console for errors  
**Solution 2**: Verify WebGL: https://get.webgl.org/  
**Solution 3**: Clear cache and hard reload (Ctrl+F5)  
**Solution 4**: Try Chrome browser (best compatibility)
