## 🧪 Testing Features

### Fast-Forward Tree Growth (Dev Mode)
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
const state = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('ecoforest_gamestate'));
state.trees[0].plantedAt = Date.now() - (25 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 25 hours ago
localStorage.setItem('ecoforest_gamestate', JSON.stringify(state));
location.reload();
```

### Reset Game State
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Check Your Data
```javascript
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('ecoforest_gamestate')));
```

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

Want to enhance the game? Here are some ideas:

### Easy Modifications
- Change tree growth speeds in `SPECIES_CONFIGS`
- Add more missions in `config/missions.json`
- Adjust eco-point rewards in `mock_api.ts`

## 🎉 You're Ready to Play!

Your EcoForest awaits! Start planting trees, complete missions, and climb the leaderboards. 

**Have fun building your forest on Base! 🌳🌿**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Trees not appearing after planting
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Ensure seeds are in inventory.

### Issue: Growth not progressing
**Solution**: Verify device time is correct. Growth uses UTC timestamps.

### Issue: Build errors
**Solution**: Run `pnpm install` then `pnpm dev` again.

### Issue: localStorage full error
**Solution**: Run `localStorage.clear()` in console, then reload.
