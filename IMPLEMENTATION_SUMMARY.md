## 📦 What Was Built

A **fully functional, self-contained Web3 forest game** that runs entirely within Ohara with:

### Core Features Implemented ✓

1. **🌱 Dual Planting System**
   - Method A: Click "PLANT" button → Select seed → Auto-plants
   - Method B: Click terrain directly → Select seed → Plants at location
   - Validation: Cannot plant in lake or too close to other trees
   - Cost system: Oak (50), Pine (60), Cherry (80), Baobab (100), Mangrove (90)

2. **⏱️ Real-Time Growth System**
   - Timestamp-based (persists across sessions)
   - Growth stages: seed → sprout → young → mature
   - Durations: 30min → 60min → 120min (configurable)
   - Visual progression: Size increases with each stage
   - Auto-refresh: Recalculates every 10 seconds

3. **💧 Watering Mechanics**
   - Click any tree to water (once per 24 hours)
   - Bonus: +10% growth speed (cumulative)
   - Reward: +2 eco-points per watering
   - Validation: Prevents duplicate watering

4. **🗑️ Trash Cleanup**
   - 5 initial trash items spawned
   - Click to clean: +5 eco-points
   - Debug spawn: Add more trash for testing
   - Tracks total cleaned in stats

5. **🌦️ Weather System**
   - 3 weather types: Sunny, Cloudy, Rain
   - Visual effects: 100 animated rain particles
   - Lighting adjustments per weather
   - Toggle button (top-right)

6. **🌅 Time-of-Day Lighting**
   - Syncs with device local time
   - Day (6am-6pm): Bright warm lighting
   - Night (6pm-6am): Dim cool lighting
   - Auto-updates every minute

7. **🏞️ Rich 3D Environment**
   - **Terrain**: 20×20 heightmap with sine wave hills (400 vertices)
   - **Lake**: 3-unit radius circle at (6, 6)
   - **Rocks**: 4 grey dodecahedrons scattered
   - **Trees**: Cylinder trunk + sphere/cone foliage (species-colored)
   - **All primitives**: No external GLB files

8. **🔧 Debug Panel**
   - Add eco-points (100 or 500)
   - Spawn trash items
   - View current stats
   - Growth stage information

9. **💾 Data Persistence**
   - localStorage for all game state
   - Keys: `ecoforest_self_contained`, `ecoforest_sample_forests`
   - Auto-save on every state change
   - Robust: Handles JSON parse errors

10. **🎨 Organic UI**
    - No dashboard panels — embedded in forest
    - Eco-points: Green leaf badge
    - Plant button: Pulsing green seed
    - Weather toggle: Purple emoji button
    - Seed menu: Wooden frame aesthetic
    - Help text: Bottom-right instructions

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (already installed)
- Modern browser with WebGL support

### Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000

# Production Build
pnpm build
pnpm start

# Type Check
pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

### First Launch

1. **Landing Screen**: Appears with forest theme
2. **Click "Enter Your Forest"**: Transitions to 3D view
3. **See**: Green terrain with hills, blue lake, grey rocks, red trash
4. **Start Playing**: Click "PLANT" button or click terrain

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Flow

### New Player Experience

1. **Start**: 500 eco-points, 7 seeds (2 Oak, 2 Pine, 1 Cherry, 1 Baobab, 1 Mangrove)
2. **Plant first tree**: Click PLANT → Select Oak (50) → Tree appears
3. **Water it**: Click tree → +2 eco-points, +10% growth
4. **Clean trash**: Click red cube → +5 eco-points
5. **Plant more**: Use earned points to buy more seeds
6. **Watch grow**: Trees automatically progress through stages
7. **Toggle weather**: Experiment with rain, clouds, sunny
8. **Debug test**: Add eco-points, spawn trash, verify stats

### Advanced Gameplay

- **Optimize placement**: Space trees evenly for aesthetic
- **Maximize growth**: Water every tree every 24 hours
- **Earn efficiently**: Clean all trash first (5 × 5 = 25 eco-points)
- **Species diversity**: Plant all 5 species for higher eco-score
- **Test persistence**: Refresh page to verify growth continues

---

## 🧪 Testing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Growth Speed (src/lib/self-contained-storage.ts)

```typescript
const GROWTH_DURATIONS_HOURS: Record<TreeSpecies, { sprout: number; young: number; mature: number }> = {
  Oak: { sprout: 0.5, young: 1, mature: 2 },
  // Adjust these values to change growth speed
  // Production example: { sprout: 6, young: 24, mature: 72 }
};
```

### Seed Costs

```typescript
const SEED_COSTS: Record<TreeSpecies, number> = {
  Oak: 50,
  Pine: 60,
  Cherry: 80,
  Baobab: 100,
  Mangrove: 90,
  // Adjust these to change economy balance
};
```

### Starting Resources

```typescript
ecoPoints: 500,  // Starting eco-points
inventory: {
  Oak: 2,        // Free Oak seeds
  Pine: 2,       // Free Pine seeds
  Cherry: 1,     // Free Cherry seed
  Baobab: 1,     // Free Baobab seed
  Mangrove: 1,   // Free Mangrove seed
},
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Expected Limitations

1. **Growth is accelerated**: Demo uses 30min/60min/120min (production would be hours/days)
2. **No multiplayer**: Friend visits not implemented (sample data exists)
3. **No missions**: Mission system not included in self-contained version
4. **Simple animations**: No physics engine, just CSS transforms
5. **Limited decorations**: Only trees implemented (rocks are static)
6. **No audio**: Sound effects not included
7. **Camera constraints**: OrbitControls limited to prevent disorientation

### Not Issues (By Design)

- **Mock wallet**: Intended for prototype (no real blockchain)
- **Simple graphics**: Low-poly primitives for performance
- **localStorage only**: No backend required for self-contained version
- **Fast growth**: Intentional for demo/testing purposes

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned for Full Version

1. **Friend Visits**: Load sample forests, rate, give hearts
2. **Leaderboards**: Top EcoForests, Most Loved, Tree Collector
3. **Missions**: Daily tasks, streak bonuses
4. **Decorations**: Place benches, flowers, mushrooms
5. **Group Trees**: Cooperative planting
6. **NFT Minting**: Mock mint rare trees
7. **Badges**: Achievement system
8. **Seasonal Events**: Limited-time content
9. **Audio**: Ambient sounds, click effects
10. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch controls, responsive UI

### Not Planned (Out of Scope)

- Real blockchain integration (this is a prototype)
- Actual GPS tree planting (requires external API)
- Real multiplayer networking (requires backend)
- Complex 3D models (keeping primitives for performance)
- Physics engine (stability over realism)

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Trees not appearing after planting?**  
A: Check eco-points balance. Oak costs 50. Use debug panel to add points.

**Q: Trees not growing?**  
A: Growth takes 30+ minutes. Check localStorage for `plantedAt` timestamps. Modify for testing.

**Q: Can't plant in location?**  
A: Ensure not in lake (6, 6) and not within 2 units of existing trees.

**Q: Page won't load?**  
A: Verify WebGL support at https://get.webgl.org/. Try Chrome browser.

**Q: Data disappeared?**  
A: Check if using private/incognito mode. localStorage may not persist.

### Emergency Reset

```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
// Will create fresh game state with starting resources
```
