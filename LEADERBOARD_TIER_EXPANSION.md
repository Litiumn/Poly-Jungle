# 🏆 EcoForest Base — Expanded Leaderboard Tier System

## Overview

The leaderboard system has been massively expanded to support large-scale player bases (up to millions of players) with dynamic tier scaling, tier progress tracking, and enhanced rewards. This document provides a complete technical reference for the enhanced system.

---

## 📊 Tier Structure

### Expanded Tier Bands

The system now supports **6 tiers** instead of the previous 5, with significantly larger rank ranges:

| Tier | Badge | Ranks | Description |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Celestial** | 👑 | 1-100 | Elite top players with animated auras |
| **Platinum** | 💎 | 101-400 | High performers close to top 100 |
| **Gold** | 🏆 | 401-1,000 | Competitive mid-upper tier |
| **Silver** | 🥈 | 1,001-5,000 | Active regular participants |
| **Bronze** | 🥉 | 5,001-20,000 | Broad entry tier for growing players |
| **Wood (Growing)** | 🪵 | 20,001+ | New players building their forest |

---

## 🔀 Dynamic Scaling Logic

### Percentile-Based Thresholds

When the total player count exceeds **50,000**, the system automatically switches to **percentile-based tier assignment** to maintain competitive balance:

```typescript
// Percentile thresholds (activated when totalPlayers > 50,000)
celestial: Top 0.2%    (e.g., top 100 of 50,000 players)
platinum:  Next 0.6%   (0.2% + 0.6% = 0.8%)
gold:      Next 1.2%   (0.8% + 1.2% = 2.0%)
silver:    Next 8.0%   (2.0% + 8.0% = 10%)
bronze:    Next 30%    (10% + 30% = 40%)
wood:      Remaining 60%
```

### Example Calculations

**For 100,000 players:**
- Celestial: Ranks 1-200 (top 0.2%)
- Platinum: Ranks 201-800 (next 0.6%)
- Gold: Ranks 801-2,000 (next 1.2%)
- Silver: Ranks 2,001-10,000 (next 8%)
- Bronze: Ranks 10,001-40,000 (next 30%)
- Wood: Ranks 40,001+ (remaining 60%)

**For 1,000,000 players:**
- Celestial: Ranks 1-2,000
- Platinum: Ranks 2,001-8,000
- Gold: Ranks 8,001-20,000
- Silver: Ranks 20,001-100,000
- Bronze: Ranks 100,001-400,000
- Wood: Ranks 400,001+

## 📈 Tier Progress Tracking

### Progress Bars

Each leaderboard entry now displays a **visual progress bar** showing proximity to the next tier:

```typescript
interface EnhancedLeaderboardEntry {
  tierProgress?: number;      // 0-100 percentage to next tier
  nextTierRank?: number;      // Rank needed to reach next tier
}
```

### Calculation Logic

Progress is calculated based on **position within current tier**:

```typescript
tierSpan = currentRange.max - currentRange.min + 1
positionInTier = rank - currentRange.min
progress = ((tierSpan - positionInTier) / tierSpan) * 100
```

**Example:**
- Player at rank #150 in Platinum tier (101-400)
- Tier span: 400 - 101 + 1 = 300 ranks
- Position in tier: 150 - 101 = 49
- Progress: ((300 - 49) / 300) * 100 = **83.67%**

Players in **Celestial tier** show 100% progress (already at top).

## 🔍 Advanced Filtering & Navigation

### View Modes

Players can filter the leaderboard using three view modes:

1. **All Players** — Show all ranked players (paginated)
2. **Top 100** — View only the top 100 elite players
3. **My Tier Only** — Filter to show only players in your current tier

### Tier Filter Dropdown

Filter by specific tiers:
- All Tiers
- 👑 Celestial (1-100)
- 💎 Platinum (101-400)
- 🏆 Gold (401-1K)
- 🥈 Silver (1K-5K)
- 🥉 Bronze (5K-20K)
- 🪵 Growing (20K+)

### Search Function

Real-time search by:
- Player username
- User ID
- Forest name (if applicable)

---

## 📄 Pagination System

### Performance Optimization

To handle large player bases efficiently:

- **50 entries per page** (configurable via `ENTRIES_PER_PAGE`)
- **Smooth page transitions** with prev/next buttons
- **Page indicator** showing current page and total pages
- **Auto-reset to page 1** when filters/search changes

### Implementation

```typescript
const ENTRIES_PER_PAGE = 50;
const totalPages = Math.ceil(filteredEntries.length / ENTRIES_PER_PAGE);

// Paginate entries
const startIndex = (currentPage - 1) * ENTRIES_PER_PAGE;
const endIndex = startIndex + ENTRIES_PER_PAGE;
const paginatedEntries = filteredEntries.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
```

---

## 🏅 Current User Stats Summary

The leaderboard displays a **personalized stats card** for the current user:

### Features
- Current rank and tier badge
- Tier name (e.g., "Platinum Tier")
- Progress percentage to next tier
- Rank target for next tier promotion

### Visual Design
- Gradient background (indigo-to-purple)
- Bold rank display
- Prominent tier progress indicator
- Clear call-to-action for rank improvement

---

## 🔒 Hidden Scoring Formula

The scoring algorithm remains **hidden from the frontend** to prevent exploitation:

### Scoring Factors (Backend Only)

```typescript
// Weighted formula (not exposed to UI)
score = 
  uniqueSpecies × 8 +
  uniqueDecorations × 3 +
  avgTreeMaturity × 5 +
  rarityScore +
  communityRating × 15 +
  badgeBonus +
  streakBonus +
  ecoPoints × 0.1
```

### Rarity Points

| Rarity Tier | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Common Grove | 1 |
| Wildwood | 3 |
| Sacred Canopy | 8 |
| Elderbark | 15 |
| Mythroot | 30 |
| Celestial Bough | 60 |
| Origin Tree | 100 |
