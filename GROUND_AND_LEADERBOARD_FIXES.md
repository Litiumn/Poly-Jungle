# Ground Size & Leaderboard Crash Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Ground Size Reduced (70x70 → 50x50)
**Problem:** Forest terrain was too large at 70x70 units  
**Solution:** Reduced to 50x50 units for a more intimate forest experience

**Changes Made:**
- Main terrain PlaneGeometry: `70x70` → `50x50`
- Gradient overlay circle radius: `35` → `25`
- Distance calculation divisor: `50` → `35`
- All decorative object spawn ranges adjusted:
  - Rocks: `60×60` range → `40×40` range
  - Fallen logs: `50×50` → `40×40`
  - Grass patches: `70×70` → `50×50`
  - Flowers: `60×60` → `40×40`
  - Bushes: `70×70` → `50×50`
  - Mushrooms: `60×60` → `40×40`

**Impact:**
- More focused gameplay area
- Better object density
- Improved visual composition
- Objects remain proportionally distributed

### 2. ✅ Leaderboard Crash Fixed
**Problem:** Crash when opening leaderboard with error:  
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
```

**Root Cause:**  
In `leaderboard-system.ts`, when creating leaderboard entries, the `badges` property was assigned directly from `user.badges` without checking if it exists. When `user.badges` was undefined, accessing `entry.badges.length` in the UI crashed.

**Solution:**  
Added defensive fallback to ensure badges is always an array:
```typescript
badges: user.badges || []
```

**Locations Fixed:**
1. `generateGlobalLeaderboard()` - Line 485
2. `generateFriendsLeaderboard()` - Line 526  
3. `generateStakeLeaderboard()` - Line 565

## Files Modified

### `src/components/forest/EnhancedTerrain.tsx`
- Changed PlaneGeometry dimensions from 70x70 to 50x50
- Adjusted all decorative object spawn ranges
- Updated gradient overlay radius
- Modified distance calculation for color variation

### `src/lib/leaderboard-system.ts`
- Added `|| []` fallback for badges in all three leaderboard generation functions
- Ensures badges is always a valid array, preventing undefined access
