# Terrain & Tree Positioning Fixes

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Water Orientation** 🌊
**Problem**: Water was perpendicular to ground instead of parallel (standing up like a wall)

**Fix**: Added `rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}` to both water meshes in `EnvironmentalObjects.tsx`
- Main water mesh (line 9)
- Ripple effect mesh (line 20)

**Result**: Water now lays flat on the ground like a proper lake

---

### 2. **Terrain Size** 📏
**Problem**: Ground was too large at 100x100 units

**Fix**: Reduced terrain dimensions in `EnhancedTerrain.tsx`:
- Main terrain: `100x100` → `70x70` (line 103)
- Gradient overlay circle: radius `50` → `35` (line 158)

**Result**: More manageable, appropriately-sized forest area

---

### 3. **Terrain Slope** ⛰️
**Problem**: Hills were too steep with height variation up to 2.6 units

**Fix**: Reduced sine wave amplitudes in `EnhancedTerrain.tsx` (lines 114-117):
- `Math.sin(x * 0.1) * 0.8` → `0.3`
- `Math.cos(y * 0.15) * 0.6` → `0.2`
- `Math.sin(x * 0.05 + y * 0.05) * 1.2` → `0.4`

**Total height variation**: `2.6 units` → `0.9 units` (65% reduction)

**Result**: Gentle, rolling hills instead of steep slopes

---

### 4. **Tree Positioning** 🌲
**Problem**: Trees were positioned at y=0, but terrain now has height variation, causing trees to be cut in half or floating

**Fix**: Created terrain height calculation system:

1. **Created `src/lib/terrain-utils.ts`**:
   - `getTerrainHeight(x, z)`: Calculates terrain height at any position
   - Matches the exact sine wave formula from `EnhancedTerrain.tsx`

2. **Updated tree components** to use terrain height:
   - `Tree.tsx` (line 40): `terrainY = getTerrainYPosition(...)`
   - `AnimatedTree.tsx` (line 71): Same calculation
   - `PlacementPreview.tsx` (line 52): Preview at correct height

**Result**: Trees now properly sit on the terrain surface at all positions

---

## Technical Implementation

### Terrain Height Calculation
```typescript
export function getTerrainHeight(x: number, z: number): number {
  // Match the sine wave formula from EnhancedTerrain.tsx
  const height =
    Math.sin(x * 0.1) * 0.3 +
    Math.cos(z * 0.15) * 0.2 +
    Math.sin(x * 0.05 + z * 0.05) * 0.4;
  
  return height;
}
```

### Tree Component Integration
```typescript
// Calculate terrain height at tree position
const terrainY = getTerrainYPosition(tree.position.x, tree.position.z);

// Position tree at correct height
<group position={[tree.position.x, terrainY, tree.position.z]}>
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/forest/EnvironmentalObjects.tsx**
   - Added water rotation for flat orientation

2. **src/components/forest/EnhancedTerrain.tsx**
   - Reduced terrain size from 100x100 to 70x70
   - Reduced hill amplitude from 2.6 to 0.9 max height
   - Reduced gradient overlay radius

3. **src/lib/terrain-utils.ts** ⭐ NEW
   - Terrain height calculation utilities
   - Deterministic height function matching terrain generation

4. **src/components/forest/Tree.tsx**
   - Integrated terrain height positioning

5. **src/components/forest/AnimatedTree.tsx**
   - Integrated terrain height positioning

6. **src/components/forest/PlacementPreview.tsx**
   - Integrated terrain height positioning

## Results

✅ Water lays flat like a proper lake  
✅ Terrain is 70x70 (manageable size)  
✅ Hills are gentle with max 0.9 unit variation  
✅ Trees sit perfectly on terrain at all positions  
✅ Preview trees match planted tree positions  
✅ Build compiles successfully with zero errors

## Before & After

### Before:
- 🔴 Water standing upright (perpendicular)
- 🔴 Terrain 100x100 (too large)
- 🔴 Hills up to 2.6 units high (too steep)
- 🔴 Trees at y=0 (floating or buried)

### After:
- 🟢 Water laying flat (parallel to ground)
- 🟢 Terrain 70x70 (appropriate size)
- 🟢 Hills up to 0.9 units (gentle slopes)
- 🟢 Trees follow terrain height (perfect placement)
